						<p>A Cipher is <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cipher">
						a secret or disguised way of writing</a>. In other words, a code. 
						For whatever reason, one may want to disguise your writings so an unwanted reader might find it 
						difficult to  <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/decipher">decipher</a> their true 
						meaning. In cryptography a cipher is a set of steps, commonly using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_cipher">key</a>, 
						that are used to <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/encipher">encipher</a> information so that it will
						be illegible or even <a href="http://ciphermachines.com/types.html#steg">invisible</a> to the casual reader.</p>

							<p>Up until the 20th century before mechanical and modern cryptography techniques were invented, 
							many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_cipher">classical ciphers</a> 
							have been utilised most notably in times of war when obscuring your communications effectively
							could give you the upper hand against your enemy.

							<p>Many forms of ciphers have been used throughout the ages. Simple substitution ciphers swapping
							letters for symbols or using a single substitution alphabet gave way to ever more complex polyalphabetic
							ciphers before some of the first computing devices were used to create ciphers that were essentially
							impossible to break with human effort alone. This website will present some the oldest classical
							ciphers that have been used in an attempt to hide the secrets and conceal the messages of people
							many years before modern cryptography was ever conceived.</p>
